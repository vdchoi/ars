Grade: 91

## ease of accessing package, help, tests:

Fine, but reliance on numDeriv not indicated.

## main help page:

Fine.

## quality of user interface:

Ok, but would be good to have defaults for a and b. 
Also use of n_per_step doesn't follow the algorithm as presented in Gilks.

No ability for user to provide initial abscissae.

## performance on my tests:

Succeeds on one truncated normal and gamma density, fails with untrapped errors on another truncated normal and narrow normal density centered at 40. Fails with incorrect detection of non-log-concavity on double exponential.

I think it's passing standard normal, but there are some small p-values.

## t density output:

Errors out with message about divergent integral. Not properly trapping non-log-concavity.

## presence of tests:

Tests pass.

Tests of a few distributions, but it would be better to use something like the K-S test rather than checking moments. Some unit tests, though none that seem to test numerical correctness. 

## code efficiency:

Very fast with default n_per_step, but note concern about n_per_step.

Not nearly as fast with n_per_step=1 (3 sec for 5000 samples). One could set things up to not recompute the upper hull information if no points added to abscissae.  

## comments in code:

Good

## code organization/clarity/elegance:

Generally easy to follow.

Good to have the various initial checks but as seen in t density example, your check for integrability is not robust. And as seen with a couple examples, your test for log-concavity is not robust.

## equality of workload:

Good; glad you spent time pair programming.

## writeup:

Nice graphical illustrations. Would be nice to see results for some examples.
